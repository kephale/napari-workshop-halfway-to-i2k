# Plugins
This module covers the following topics:
* [Find Plugins](#find-plugins)  
* [Install Plugins](#install-plugins)
* [Explore Plugins](#explore-plugins)

## Find Plugins
Explore [napari-hub.org](https://www.napari-hub.org/) to search for plugins for analysis tasks.

napari is designed to be a domain-agnostic, visualization software that is easily extensible through its plugin ecosystem. napari-hub.org is a platform to discover, share, and learn about plugins.

To learn about updates from the napari-hub team, sign up for the quarterly newsletter on the bottom of any napari-hub page in the **Sign up to receive updates** bar.

## Install Plugins
* To install plugins, we recommend:  
    * Opening **Plugins**>**Install/Uninstall Plugins** in the napari menu
    * **_Waiting for the plugin list to populate_** - this may take a few moments
    * Searching for the desired plugin in the **Search for a plugin by keyword or author** search bar
    * Clicking the install button  

       **Note:** Some plugins wonâ€™t populate their features until napari has been re-opened, so you may have to close napari and re-open it.  

## Explore Plugins    
* Read the documentation, install, and try using the following plugins:  
    * [napari-bio-sample-data](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-bio-sample-data) (if it is not already installed). 
        * Use **Open File**>**Open Sample**>**napari-bio-sample-data**>**3D nuclei** if needed.  
        * Explore the layer controls of all 3 layer types
    * [napari-plot-profile](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-plot-profile) Explore sample data in **File**>**Open Sample** by plotting line profiles.  
    * [napari-brightness-contrast](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-brightness-contrast) Adjust the contrast to visualize the data.   
    * [napari-animation](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-animation) Make an animation of rotating the nuclei in 3D  
    * On napari-hub.org, use any of the filters on the left or search terms in the center search bar to look for additional plugins to try out.

    The next module in this workshop will cover using napari with jupyter notebooks.
