## Find plugins
Explore [napari-hub.org](https://www.napari-hub.org/) to search for plugins for analysis tasks.

napari is designed to be a domain-agnostic, visualization software that is easily extensible through its plugin ecosystem. napari-hub.org is a platform to discover, share, and learn about plugins.

To learn about updates from the napari-hub team, sign up for the quarterly newsletter on the bottom of any napari-hub page in the **Sign up to receive updates** bar.

## Install plugins
* To install plugins, we recommend:  
    * Opening **Plugins**>**Install/Uninstall Plugins** in the napari menu
    * **_Waiting for the plugin list to populate_**
    * Searching for the desired plugin in the **Search for a plugin by keyword or author** search bar
    * Clicking the install button  

       **Note:** Some plugins wonâ€™t populate their features until napari has been re-opened, so you may have to close napari and re-open it.  

## Prepare for the next exercise    
* Read the documentation and install the following plugins:  
    * [napari-bio-sample-data](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-bio-sample-data) (if it is not already installed). 
        * Use **Open File**>**Open Sample**>**napari-bio-sample-data**>**3D nuclei** if needed.  
        * Explore the layer controls of all 3 layer types
    * [napari-plot-profile](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-plot-profile) Explore sample data in **File**>**Open Sample** by plotting line profiles.  
    * [napari-brightness-contrast](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-brightness-contrast) Adjust the contrast to visualize the data.   
    * [napari-animation](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-animation) Make an animation of rotating the nuclei in 3D  
    * On napari-hub.org, use any of the filters on the left or search terms in the center search bar to look for additional plugins to try out.
